# QCrypTool

QCrypTool is a fork of CrypTool 1 geared towards platform independency.

Please visit http://www.cryptool.org for information on the original project.

The goal of this project is to provide the functionality of CrypTool 1 on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. QCrypTool is written in C++ just like the original CrypTool, but it is based on Qt instead of MFC to be platform-independent.

This repository contains two main branches: **master** and **experimental**.

- The **master** branch contains code which can be compiled successfully as-is.
- The **experimental** branch contains the most recent features and fixes, therefore the code may not even compile successfully. As soon as a certain degree of stability is reached, this branch is continuously merged into the master branch.

A DEVELOPERS.md document will soon be added to guide contributors through the build process.
